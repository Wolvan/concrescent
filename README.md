## Installation
1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
2. Clone this repository.
3. You can insert a `concrescent-reg.sql` in the `/init` if you prefer another database instead of the default.
4. Run `./prepare` in a shell at the root of the project. Default settings should get the app working.
5. You can customise the app by configuring `concrescent.php`.
6. Log in to `https://localhost/admin` with the username and password admin/admin.

## Troubleshooting
Once set up, CONcrescent should work without issues under most web hosting configurations.
If you encounter any issues, `chmod a+x cm2/admin/doctor` and run `cm2/admin/doctor/` again
and/or check the following.

### There is a blank screen or the error message "500 Internal Server Error" or "Communication Failure" when registering, submitting an application, or accepting an application.
*   Make sure the cURL extension for PHP is installed.
*   Make sure OpenSSL is up to date.
*   Make sure sendmail and PHP are correctly configured to send email.
*   Make sure the PayPal section of the configuration file is correct.

### Some images, such as QR codes, the Rooms & Tables map, or badge artwork, do not appear.
*   Make sure the GD library for PHP is installed.
*   Make sure the badge printing section of the configuration file is correct.
*   Make sure the settings on the Badge Printing Setup page are correct.

### Badge types become available or unavailable at the wrong time, or CONcrescent is treating some minors as adults or vice versa.
*   Make sure the web server's time is set correctly.
*   Make sure the MySQL server's time is set correctly.
*   Make sure the correct time zone is specified at the top of the configuration file.
*   Make sure the correct time zone is specified in the database section of the configuration file.
*   Make sure time zone tables have been loaded in the `mysql` database using [`mysql_tzinfo_to_sql`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-tzinfo-to-sql.html).
*   Run `cm2/admin/timecheck.php` to verify PHP time and MySQL time are synchronized.

### Search pages do not return the correct search results, or return search results with incorrect or incomplete information.
The search index may be out of date. Press Ctrl-Shift-Zero on the search page with the issue to access the "rebuild search index" page. Rebuilding the search index may take several minutes, and if the rebuilding process fails, you will have to start it all over again, so do not make a habit out of doing this.

### I'm using a QR code scanner to check people in.
Press Ctrl-Shift-8 on the check-in page to enable check-in with QR codes. When a QR code is scanned that was produced by CONcrescent, the check-in page will immediately display that person's record.

### I'm not using a QR code scanner to check people in.
Press Ctrl-Shift-9 on the check-in page to disable check-in with QR codes.
